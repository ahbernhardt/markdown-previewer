# Markdown Previewer

> Build a Markdown Previewer. This is the second project of [FreeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer/). The project was built with React.

Check for [Live Demo](https://anhnguyen.page/fcc-markdown-previewer/)

## Objective

Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app or other frontend framework that is functionally similar to this: <https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/GrZVVO>. 

### User stories

- [x] I can see a `textarea` element with a corresponding `id="editor"`.

- [x] I can see an element with a corresponding `id="preview"`.
- [x] When I enter text into the `#editor` element, the `#preview` element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
- [x] When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the `#editor` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: <https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked>).
- [x] When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the `#editor` field should contain the valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
- [x] When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the `#editor` field should be rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element.
- [x] Optional Bonus: When I click a link rendered by my markdown previewer, the link is opened up in a new tab (HINT: read the Marked.js docs for this one!).
- [x] Optional Bonus: My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
